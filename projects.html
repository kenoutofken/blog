            <h2>Project Rationale</h2>
            <p>
              The "ReadAloud" app concept was born from my personal experience
              working in a restaurant as a server. I often saw parents trying to
              keep their children occupied with games and cartoons on their
              devices. I realized this was a lost opportunity to engage kids in
              a more educational experience during their screen time. My concept
              for the "ReadAloud" app is to use AI to create a karaoke-like
              experience for kids, that encourages them to read the ebooks out
              loud, with the AI acting as a tool to help kids with words that
              they struggle with. The app tracks progress to inform parents of
              their child's learning, but ultimately the goal is to attract
              children with an experience that is fun and engaging. AI will also
              be used to create animations for each page to immerse children in
              their reading.

            <h2>Defining the Problem</h2>
            <p>
              Parents often struggle to find activities for their children that
              allows them to have fun while also facilitating growth and
              learning. Cartoons and games are often what they turn to from my
              own personal observations, but these activities are passive, and
              do not provide any tools for the child to learn nor any ways for
              parents to document their child's educational development.
              “ReadAloud” aims to solve this problem by creating an app that is
              easy and fun to use for kids, while also creating a learning
              experience that fosters growth. It combines the educational
              experience of reading with animated cartoons. All the while, the
              app provides tools that allow parents to see their child's
              learning through achievements and progress tracking.
            </p>
            <h2>Identifying the User</h2>
            <p>
              The app is designed for young children between the ages of 6-11.
              Children's books are provided at various levels to allow for
              children across the age range and skill level to benefit from
              their experience.

          <h2>Concept Prototype</h2>
          <p>
            On the left is the final high fidelity concept for my app. The
            design emphasizes a personalized experience for the user, with a
            minimalist design that focuses the user on the reading activity.
            Emphasis was placed on creating a user experience that puts achievements
            front and center to encourage the user to continue interacting with the app.
            As the concept of the app is to encourage the user to read. The reading screen
            presents a simple interface layout for the user, and highlights the call to
            action, which in this case is to flip to the next page of the book. Again,
            this is because the primary focus of the app is to encourage the user to
            continue to read. Because the animation element of the app is very important to
            attract the target demographic, the panel for the animation is large and
            remains the focus of the reading screen.
