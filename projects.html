        <h2>Project Rationale</h2>
        <p>
          The "ReadAloud" app concept was born from my personal experience
          working in a restaurant as a server. I often saw parents trying to
          keep their children occupied with games and cartoons on their devices.
          I realized this was a lost opportunity to engage kids in a more
          educational experience during their screen time. My concept for the
          "ReadAloud" app is to use AI to create a karaoke-like experience for
          kids, that encourages them to read the ebooks out loud, with the AI
          acting as a tool to help kids with words that they struggle with. The
          app tracks progress to inform parents of their child's learning, but
          ultimately the goal is to attract children with an experience that is
          fun and engaging. AI will also be used to create animations for each
          page to immerse children in their reading.
        </p>
        <h2>Defining the Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Parents often struggle to find activities for their children that
          allows them to have fun while also facilitating growth and learning.
          Cartoons and games are often what they turn to from my own personal
          observations, but these activities are passive, and do not provide any
          tools for the child to learn nor any ways for parents to document
          their child's educational development. “ReadAloud” aims to solve this
          problem by creating an app that is easy and fun to use for kids, while
          also creating a learning experience that fosters growth. It combines
          the educational experience of reading with animated cartoons. All the
          while, the app provides tools that allow parents to see their child's
          learning through achievements and progress tracking.
        </p>
        <h2>Identifying the User</h2>
        <p>
          The app is designed for young children between the ages of 6-11.
          Children's books are provided at various levels to allow for children
          across the age range and skill level to benefit from their experience.

        />
        <h2>Concept Prototype</h2>
        <p>
          Below is the final high fidelity concept for my app. The design
          emphasizes a personalized experience for the user, with a minimalist
          design that focuses the user on the reading activity.
